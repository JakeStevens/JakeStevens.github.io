      <title>Quicksilver</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quicksilver is a 2D accelerator implemented using SystemVerilog. It is designed to plug into existing SoCs via the APB bus. A small graphics library was also developed for the accelerator to ease the programming burden. This design has been integrated into a past chip designed by Purdue&amp;rsquo;s SoC team and the functionality of the accelerator and C library have been verified on an FPGA implementation of the SoC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above .gif was generated using only the accelerator&amp;rsquo;s primitives via a mapped simulation of Quicksilver, using 24 bit color at a 640 x 480 resolution. 32 frames were rendered at 125 frames per second.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RISCV-Business is an open source project aimed at creating a configurable, extendable RISC-V core for university researchers and those trying to learn about computer architecture through a hands on approach.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TrackRx</title>
      <link>https://jakestevens.github.io/project/track-rx/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TrackRx is a wireless, internet-connected pill bottle designed to solve the adherence and abuse problem, designed by a four-member team in one semester for Purdue University’s ECE 477 Digital Systems Senior Design Project Course. It makes it easier for patients to take their medication correctly and harder for them to abuse prescription medications by dispensing a single dose of medication at a time and providing medication adherence data in real-time to the patient’s pharmacist, doctor, and other caretakers. Along with the pill bottle itself, the TrackRx system consists of an Android app for the patient, a desktop application for the pharmacist/doctor, and a backend database and cloud service to communicate with the bottle and applications and securely store patient prescription and adherence information. Taken together, TrackRx is an innovative system which improves upon the standard pill bottle and prescription process with the goal of coming substantially closer to solving the problem of prescription drug adherence and abuse. TrackRx was awarded 2nd place in Purdue ECE&amp;rsquo;s Spark Challenge in Spring of 2016, and was named &amp;ldquo;Best Use of Wireless Technology&amp;rdquo; in Texas Instrument&amp;rsquo;s Innovation Challenge in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
